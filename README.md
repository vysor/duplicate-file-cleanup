# duplicate-file-cleanup
This is a tool to find duplicate files (like images and videos) by adding the file type extension to the list in the code.

You can bar directories from being included in the duplicate export list, by using a similar line to line 35.

The requirements for this script is to have a manual review process of any duplicate files, and then build your own script to delete those, hence there is no code to delete any duplicates.
